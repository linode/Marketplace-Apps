### App Name
SimpleX server

### App description
SimpleX server is a message broker for SimpleX chat network - an open-source decentralized chat with a focus on usersâ€™ privacy.

SimpleX chat:
- ensures meta-data privacy by not using global user identities - no phone numbers, emails, usernames or any other globally unique identifiers.
- uses [decentralized client-server network topology](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#network-topology) and privacy-preserving message routing protocol.
- has no dependence on DNS for the core network; optional DNS-based user addresses will be provided in the future to simplify the initial connections, but not for the message routing.

The terminal chat client is available in [simplex-chat repo](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat) - you can either build it from source or download the binary for Linux, Windows or Mac from [the latest release](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/releases/latest).
