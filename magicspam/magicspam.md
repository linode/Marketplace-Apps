## App Information

### App Name

MagicSpam

### App description

MagicSpam is a powerful Anti-Spam and Email Security solution for Control Panels (cPanel and Plesk).

Stop inbound spam from entering your server right at the SMTP layer to lower bandwidth and overhead, as well as secure mailboxes on your server from being compromised and used to send outbound spam.

Based on the same security technologies used by ISP's and Telco's, MagicSpam is more than just an anti-spam solution and also an email security solution which allows email administrators to configure rule-based and reputation-based policies, blacklists and whitelists, rate limiters, and authentication restrictions.

MagicSpam installs directly onto the email server without any need to change A/MX records to protect unlimited users and domains. MagicSpam also integrates natively into the control panel interface and comes equipped with log and statistic modules to help with the management of an email server. MagicSpam is deployed in over 83 countries worldwide and protects millions of mailboxes everyday.

### Version Number

The version number depends on the MagicSpam Product Tier (LITE or PRO) and the Web Panel (cPanel or Plesk).

    MagicSpam PRO for Plesk 2.1-16.1
    MagicSpam LITE for Plesk 2.0.23-1

    MagicSpam PRO for cPanel 2.1-15.2
    MagicSpam LITE for cPanel 2.0.10-1

If multiple version numbers are not supported, then this can be left blank.

Note that MagicSpam documentation differs from other Apps documentation as:

* MagicSpam needs to run alongside with a supported Control Panel
* MagicSpam needs a license key which can be purchased from our webstore

So additional information on the matter has been included in the documentation to inform and guide users.
