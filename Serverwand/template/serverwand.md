### App description
Website management without the configuration hassle.

ServerWand is a magical control panel for managing websites and servers. Host multiple sites on a single server, manage apps, firewall, databases, backups, system users, cron jobs, SSL and email with an intuitive interface. Apps like WordPress can be installed with a single click. Staging areas can be created so that changes can be tested before being synced back with the live site. Git integration is available for users looking to sync repository changes on push. All interactions are sent using vanilla SSH commands just as a sysadmin would. There is no proprietary software installed so that you are always in control.
