Getting started after deploying Cloudron

After creating a Cloudron One-Click Linode, you need to visit the Linode’s IP address in a browser to finish configuring Cloudron.

When you visit the setup page, you’ll see a domain setup screen asking you for the primary domain of Cloudron.

* Provide a domain like example.com. Cloudron's admin interface will then be available at the my.example.com and apps can be installed into
  subdomains like blog.example.com, git.example.com and so on. More domains can be added after installation is complete in the Domains view.

* Once you click 'Next', Cloudron will automatically configure the DNS, setup certificates and redirect you to `https://my.example.com`.

* You can now setup a Cloudron administrator and start using Cloudron!
